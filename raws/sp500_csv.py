# Collecting a lot of Data from Yahoo can take 20-30 minutes
# Therefore storing locally is sometimes _really_ preferred
# THIS CAN TAKE A LOT OF TIME.

# #Wikipedia uses "." instead of "-" in their list. Had to translate "." to "-" so it would get past Berkshire Hathaway. Just for anyone running into this.
# Added this into the initial save_sp500_tickers for loop before it appends the tickers:
# mapping = str.maketrans(".","-")
# ticker = ticker.translate(mapping)
# You will need to delete list file and rerun save_sp500_tickers function.ï»¿
